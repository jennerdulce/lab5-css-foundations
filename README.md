# Lab 5: CSS Foundations by Replication
## Link: [jennerdulce-lab5-css-foundations](https://github.com/jennerdulce/lab5-css-foundations)
## Overview
This lab builds upon your HTML knowledge from Lab 4 and introduces you to modern CSS layout techniques. You'll learn how CSS Grid and Flexbox solve real-world layout problems, and how small details like hover states and spacing create polished, professional interfaces.

- Build semantic HTML structure using appropriate elements for a login page
- Learn modern CSS layout techniques with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Implement CSS custom properties (variables) for maintainable styling
- Apply appropriate CSS units (rem, em, %, vh, vw) for responsive design
- Create interactive states with hover effects and transitions
- Develop attention to detail with polish and refinement
- Practice replicating a design from a reference image

## Project Goals
By the end of this lab, we will have:

### Login Page
- A two-column layout using CSS Grid
- A blue branded section on the left with centered text,  The area is actually using a subtle gradient you could replicate!
- A white login form section on the right
Semantic form elements with labels
- A styled button with hover state
Appropriate spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

### Styles
- Layout structure (Grid for columns, Flexbox for content alignment)
- Typography (font sizes, weights, spacing)
- Colors (background, text, button states)
- Form styling (inputs, labels, buttons)
- Interactive states (hover effects)
- Spacing and polish details

## Development Approach
This project follows a step-by-step development approach:

1. Create a styles.css file in the docs directory.
2. CSS Variables: Start by defining CSS custom properties for as many things as possible conisder:
-  Colors (primary blue, white, text colors, hover states)
-  Spacing values (padding, margins, gaps)
-  Font sizes and families
-  Border radius values
3. CSS Reset/Normalize: Include basic reset styles.  There are many ways you might approach this.
4. Layout with CSS Grid: Create the two-column layout using CSS Grid
5. Content Alignment with Flexbox: Use Flexbox to center content within sections
6. Form Field Styling: Style the labels and inputs for pleasing layout to match the image.  Note you may also find HTML attributes useful for better form use!
7. Button Styling:
- You must implement a hover state that changes the background color
- Consider adding a subtle transition for smooth state changes for a hover
8. Typography: Use appropriate sizes, weights, etc. to match the replication
9. Polish Details: Note every little detail like paddings, a shadow, placeholder text, etc.
10. Watch Your Units: Demonstrate understanding by using relative units where possible (rem, em, vh, etc.) and px values only where appropriate.
